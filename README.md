## IoT Course 2020 - MSc Engineering in computer science - Sapienza

We are a group of students at the MS Course in Engineering in Computer Science at the Sapienza university in Rome supported by a Design Advisor, and in this GitHub repository we will present the project that we worked on to provide the Arte Classica Museum of Sapienza a new experience for the museum visitors as well as helping the curators understand what are the most loved art pieces in the gallery.
The project was developed as part of the Internet of Things course, here are our LinkedIn profiles:

## Description

Look at M.E. is an IoT device which is able to improve the user experience for the museum visitors and to provide important data to the museum curator.

Look at M.E. use a HC-SR04 proximity sensor implemented in a Elegoo UNO R3 board capable of activating a light-guided tour supported also by an audio explaination of the art pieces in order to emphasize differents feature of an art display.
Moreover, it can build a table to show in real time the distance to the statues of the museum visitors, to make sure that no one is getting too close to an art piece.
The project's development will be reported following each step and new implementation, in fact in this repository you can find the documents of the present state of the product as well as the older markdown files and video.
